Hello fellow readers I am back with my next blog, which is for the book named “The Secret” by Rhonda Byrne , this is a must read book for the people out there who want to live a prosperous and lavish lifestyle and many more things which you can visualize. This book being one of the best seller is recommended to people who want to eradicate issues out of their lives. Read it and I am sure you will have a greater insight to look through difficulties. <br />

## About the book <br />

The Secret talks about different laws which exist in nature, which we should believe in to get a life we seek. These laws are law of visualization, law of attraction and law of believe. This book beautifully describes that you are the one who creates the world around you, your thoughts are world builders. Everything you have or you face is created by you and attrated by you. Your thoughts attract things  so are  the things you face daily, you ask for something you get it, this is the law of attraction but you should not have a certain amount of doubt in it, you have to believe that whatever you ask is arriving, this is law of belief.No matter what the thing is, bad or good it shall come. <br />  
This book mainly focuses on law of belief and attraction, to attract good things in you life you need to think good and positive and believe and feel it like you have recieved the thing. You want money you can attract it, good grades you can attract it, good life partner, best house and what not. You can attract anything but you have to believe in it completely and things will follow. The thumb rule to follow is always be positive because positive energy attracts positive thing. The example I can give is "Sometimes it happens our day starts badly and eventually all things becomes bad or gets bad", therefore it is necessary to be optimistic . <br />  
This book also tells us about the thinking of a guy who has been always on the losing side and the one always winning. The first one has attracted negative things through his negative mindset and the other one has always attracted positive things. This book tells us how to visualize things, attract it and believe it, as it is there and you will surely get it. This book has done wonders to many people and I surely believe it can do to yours. Just believe in it and see your life changing.<br />  

Thanks !
