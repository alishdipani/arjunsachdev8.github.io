Hello fellow readers, here I am with my first blog, which is for the book named “Rich Dad Poor Dad” by Robert Kiyosaki , this is a must read book for the people out there who want to start their own business, want to learn about financial intelligence, want to get rich, people  who are in a rat race and want to come out of that.  This is the most recommended book for millionaires.

## About the book


From our school days we have been taught to study hard, get good grades, go to a nice university and get a good job and get fat salary. Schools are teaching us how to work for money but we are not taught how to make money work for us. This is due to fact that there is complete lack of financial education. Getting a good job does not mean by working in that job you will get rich, it just means you are in a rat race where your expenses will grow with your salary, knowing about where to make money work for you is the thing to get rich.
This book mainly focuses on assets and liabilities, Asset are things which puts money in your pocket and liabilities are things which takes money out of your pocket. This book has a very famous quote “Rich people acquire assets, the middle and poor acquire liabilities”. This book is all about financial education on how to generate cash flow from your assets that will take care of your expenses, how to gain more passive income.
This book also tells us about the thinking of a rich and a poor guy, how if we get into a comfort zone and  do not want to come out of it, even if we know that we are in a rat race. The author shares numerous incidents about his rich dad and his poor dad, how one who was highly qualified with no financial education had no money left at the end of the month, and one rich dad who had meagerly studied but was rich in financial education and was one of the richest man that era had ever known.
I suggest to all those who want to become rich and get financial freedom please do read this book, I surely know that it will change the way you look at things in a financial way.

Thanks and Cheers!
